# Using a VPN

What to do if the site does not open?

Some websites on European and American platforms (Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, AWS) are sometimes inaccessible. This might be why you're unable to use Hexlet exercises, sites with documentation ([eslint.org](http://eslint.org/), [python.org](http://python.org/), [redux.js.org](http://redux.js.org/)), and services for developers (surge.sh).

If the site doesn't work, try connecting via a VPN or proxy, rather than directly. For occasional use, free VPN services, such as these, will also be fine:

* [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/pricing)
* [ZenMate](https://zenmate.com/free-vpn)
* [Private Tunnel](https://www.privatetunnel.com/phome/login/#/Downloads)
